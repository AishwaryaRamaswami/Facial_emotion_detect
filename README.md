Facial Expression Detection

Introduction:

This project aims in detecting the Facial Expressions on human faces using convolutional neural networks and OpenCV. This model used the FER2013 dataset for the training purpose and a live webcam feed is used to detect the human expression and classify according to the label.

Requirements:

* Python, OpenCV, keras with TensorFlow 

Dataset:

Download FER2013 dataset from Kaggle for usage. It consists of 38887pixel values of images of 48x48 size in greyscale. We use the Pillow library for image manipulation and augmentation.

Evaluation:

The model scored a train accuracy 0f 91% and test accuracy of 63%.
